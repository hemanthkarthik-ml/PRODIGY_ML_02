# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project involves segregating retail store customers into different groups using unsupervised learning. The goal is to help the business better understand customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Dataset

- **Features used:**
  - `Annual Income (k$)`

## Project Highlights
- Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualized customer distribution using:

  - Pair plots
  - Scatter plots
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers
- Used the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters
- Interpreted the clusters based on income and spending behavior

## Objectives
